    <h2>What is NPP?</h2>
    <p>
      National People's Power (NPP) is a political movement made up of 21
      different groups, including political parties, youth groups, women's
      groups, trade unions, and other civil society organisations. It was
      established in 2019 as a result of a series of conversations about the
      need for a progressive political platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NPPâ€™s main aim is to build a strong, grassroots movement that could
      spark much-needed social, political, and economic changes in Sri Lanka.
      These include a non-corrupt, service-oriented, accountable, and
      transparent political culture; economic democracy with greater
      participation in the economy and fairer distribution of economic benefits;
      strong social protections; and an inclusive, democratic Sri Lankan
      identity.
